# My nvim backup!

Welcome to my nvim journey. This all started with a fork of [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim), which is a fork of [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) that splits the config file into multiple smaller files, so that they are easier to navigate. If I remember I will document any changes I make to my configuration here. Just in case anyone is interested in it.

### Changes
- `[2024-01-02]` - initial installation

### Installation

Requirements:
* Make sure to review the readmes of the plugins if you are experiencing errors. In particular:
  * [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) is required for multiple [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim#suggested-dependencies) pickers.
* See [Windows Installation](#Windows-Installation) if you have trouble with `telescope-fzf-native`

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |

Clone kickstart.nvim:

- on Linux
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

The `Lazy` plugin manager will start automatically on the first run and install the configured plugins - as can be seen in the introduction video. After the installation is complete you can press `q` to close the `Lazy` UI and **you are ready to go**! Next time you run nvim `Lazy` will no longer show up.

If you would prefer to hide this step and run the plugin sync from the command line, you can use:

```sh
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa
```

### Recommended Steps

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo (so that you have your own copy that you can modify) and then installing you can install to your machine using the methods above.

> **NOTE**  
> Your fork's url will be something like this: `https://github.com/<your_github_username>/kickstart-modular.nvim.git`

### Configuration And Extension

* Inside of your copy, feel free to modify any file you like! It's your copy!
* Feel free to change any of the default options in `init.lua` to better suit your needs.
* For adding plugins, there are 3 primary options:
  * Add new configuration in `lua/custom/plugins/*` files, which will be auto sourced using `lazy.nvim` (uncomment the line importing the `custom/plugins` directory in the `lua/lazy-plugins.lua` file to enable this)
  * Modify `init.lua` with additional plugins.
  * Include the `lua/kickstart/plugins/*` files in your configuration.

You can also merge updates/changes from the repo back into your fork, to keep up-to-date with any changes for the default configuration.

#### Example: Adding an autopairs plugin

In the file: `lua/custom/plugins/autopairs.lua`, add:

```lua
-- File: lua/custom/plugins/autopairs.lua

return {
  "windwp/nvim-autopairs",
  -- Optional dependency
  dependencies = { 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp' },
  config = function()
    require("nvim-autopairs").setup {}
    -- If you want to automatically add `(` after selecting a function or method
    local cmp_autopairs = require('nvim-autopairs.completion.cmp')
    local cmp = require('cmp')
    cmp.event:on(
      'confirm_done',
      cmp_autopairs.on_confirm_done()
    )
  end,
}
```

This will automatically install [windwp/nvim-autopairs](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs) and enable it on startup. For more information, see documentation for [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
